Pure political speak. Why can't he be truthful and say "disloyal guy, no friend!"<|endoftext|>.@seanhannity should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I "ran for president twice." Never ran, merely considered running!<|endoftext|>The Carson story is either a total fabrication or, if true, even worse-trying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend!<|endoftext|>A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the @FoxNews poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner!<|endoftext|>Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio. So do two people who worked with him. Said he used the wrong credit card! Sure.<|endoftext|>Such bad reporting: A puff piece on Ben Carson in the @nytimes states that Carson "is trying to solidify his lead." But I am #1, easily!

China not part but will get their way in later.<|endoftext|>The @WSJ Editorial Board is so wrong, so often. They got info from an incorrect story in another pub. Why not watch and listen to debate.<|endoftext|>When and how are the dummies at the @WSJ going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me. I want "smart" trade deals.<|endoftext|>Why wouldn't the @WSJ call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong. No wonder it is doing poorly!<|endoftext|>We, as a country, either have borders or we don't. IF WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY!<|endoftext|>.@KarlRove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP. This moron wasted $430 million on political campaigns and lost 100%<|endoftext|>Why does the failing @WSJ write a false editorial about me and let dummy @KarlRove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper?<|endoftext|>.@WSJ and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal.
<|endoftext|>Total fool @KarlRove is part of the Republican Establishment problem. An all talk, no action dummy!

Will you apologize?<|endoftext|>.@CarlyFiorina  Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper & pathological disease. I didn’t say it, he did. Apology?<|endoftext|>.@CarlyFiorina I only said I was on @60Minutes four weeks ago with Putin—never said I was in Green Room. Separate pieces—great ratings!<|endoftext|>.@CarlyFiorina had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign!<|endoftext|>.@seanhannity  Carly, whose campaign is dead, is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope! Sad.<|endoftext|>President Obama said "ISIL continues to shrink" in an interview just hours before the horrible attack in Paris. He is just so bad!

Well, welcome to the wonderful world of politics!<|endoftext|>People have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems!<|endoftext|>Why doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!<|endoftext|>Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it<|endoftext|>Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press<|endoftext|>.@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!<|endoftext|>.@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.<|endoftext|>I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!<|endoftext|>I am in Trump International Hotel, Las Vegas, getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight. Look forward -   hope I get treated fairly!<|endoftext|>. #JoeTheismann was great as a political analyst on @FoxNews. He knows far more than football. Thanks for the nice words Joe!<|endoftext|>Highly respected PUBLIC POLICY POLLING (PPP) just announced that I am number one in IOWA. Thank you!<|endoftext|>Thank you, so many people have given me credit for winning the debate last night. All polls agree. It was fun and interesting!<|endoftext|>Thank you @davidaxelrod for your nice words this morning on @CNN. It was a good night!<|endoftext|>.@MarkHalperin works so hard but just doesn't have a natural instinct for politics. Others do, and those are the people you want to follow!<|endoftext|>Bill O'Reilly calls Trump and  campaign brilliant. In first place by 27 points.<|endoftext|>Thank you for the nice words @ktmcfarland. The debate was interesting, and fun. Keep up the great work!<|endoftext|>Jeb Bush had a tough night at the debate. Now he'll probably take some of his special interest money, he is their puppet, and buy ad's.<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton is weak and ineffective - no strength, no stamina.<|endoftext|>.@MelindaDC  Don’t misrepresent in order to make a point. I was always tough on ISIS--as you’ll find out after I get elected.<|endoftext|>I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name & don’t be ashamed of it!<|endoftext|>Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising!<|endoftext|>.@JebBush has embarrassed himself & his family with his incompetent campaign for President. He should remain true to himself.<|endoftext|>The last thing our country needs is another BUSH! Dumb as a rock!<|endoftext|>See, Sanders backed Hillary on E-mails at the debate, hurting himself, and then she threw him under the bus (but failed). Disloyal person!<|endoftext|>President Obama spends so much time speaking of the so-called Carbon footprint, and yet he flies all the way to Hawaii on a massive old 747.<|endoftext|>.@GStephanopoulos stupidly believes that Hillary wants to run against me because she said so. She says that so people believe it - opposite!<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton lied when she said that "ISIS is using video of Donald Trump as a recruiting tool." This was fact checked by @FoxNews: FALSE<|endoftext|>.@JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!<|endoftext|>It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential!<|endoftext|>.@MissUniverse final 3 on now. Great people, great new owner @IMG. WATCH.<|endoftext|>.@JebBush today said he didn't want to be the front-runner, he would rather be where he is now, 2%. That is the talk of a loser, can't win!<|endoftext|>Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!<|endoftext|>Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology!<|endoftext|>I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.<|endoftext|>Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!<|endoftext|>Just out: TRUMP GOP DEBATE - 18,000,000. CLINTON DEMOCRAT DEBATE - 6,700,000. And they were on major network vs. cable!<|endoftext|>Getting ready to go to the great State of Michigan. Big crowd tonight. Make America Great Again!<|endoftext|>It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS --  not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!<|endoftext|>A suicide bomber has just killed U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!<|endoftext|>Thanks @AndreaTantaros for all of your kind words and thoughts. Big progress is being made. Keep up the great work!<|endoftext|>Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.<|endoftext|>Getting ready to leave for Michigan - will be an amazing evening! See you there.<|endoftext|>Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.<|endoftext|>.@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!<|endoftext|>Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?<|endoftext|>Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate?<|endoftext|>.@JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent.<|endoftext|>Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!<|endoftext|>Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!<|endoftext|>Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge!<|endoftext|>When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!<|endoftext|>It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!<|endoftext|>We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again!<|endoftext|>Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category. Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10<|endoftext|>The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic. Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card.<|endoftext|>The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad<|endoftext|>.@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!<|endoftext|>Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump<|endoftext|>It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead<|endoftext|>Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!<|endoftext|>Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity<|endoftext|>Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!<|endoftext|>In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!<|endoftext|>Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!<|endoftext|>Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!<|endoftext|>Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly<|endoftext|>Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!<|endoftext|>Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!<|endoftext|>I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>.@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!<|endoftext|>.@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!<|endoftext|>Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!<|endoftext|>.@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!<|endoftext|>Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!<|endoftext|>We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.<|endoftext|>Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!<|endoftext|>When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!<|endoftext|>@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!<|endoftext|>.@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!<|endoftext|>The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.<|endoftext|>The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it<|endoftext|>Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE!<|endoftext|>A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders!<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate!<|endoftext|>I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina!<|endoftext|>It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD!<|endoftext|>R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW!<|endoftext|>The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change!<|endoftext|>.@BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie!<|endoftext|>Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC<|endoftext|>Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST!<|endoftext|>If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!<|endoftext|>The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD<|endoftext|>Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX!<|endoftext|>Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now!<|endoftext|>Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster!<|endoftext|>Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist!<|endoftext|>.@jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it!<|endoftext|>My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.<|endoftext|>So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!<|endoftext|>We need a real President! <|endoftext|>.@CharlesHurt   You were great on @seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting<|endoftext|>I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  @RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity<|endoftext|>I predict that dying @UnionLeader newspaper, which has been run into the ground by publisher "Stinky" Joe McQuaid, will be dead in 2 years!<|endoftext|>A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>.@JebBush has spent  $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!  @hughhewitt<|endoftext|>People ask, "why do you tweet and re-tweet to millions about @JebBush when he is so low in the polls?" Because of his big $ hit ads on me!<|endoftext|>I would feel sorry for @JebBush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of $'s of hit ads on me<|endoftext|>Do you believe that The State Department, on NEW YEAR'S EVE, just released more of Hillary's e-mails. They just want it all to end. BAD!<|endoftext|>I would like to wish everyone A HAPPY AND HEALTHY NEW YEAR. WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO, FINALLY, MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN AND GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>HAPPY NEW YEAR & THANK YOU!  <|endoftext|>Well, the year has officially begun. I have many stops planned and will be working very hard to win so that we can turn our country around!<|endoftext|>The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me. It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped!<|endoftext|>Thank you so much to  for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year. This is indeed a great honor for me!<|endoftext|>.@JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!<|endoftext|>.@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!<|endoftext|>I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women!<|endoftext|>When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$!<|endoftext|>Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.!<|endoftext|>Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening.<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate.<|endoftext|>Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied!<|endoftext|>Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm!<|endoftext|>Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch.<|endoftext|>.@chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before." Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won!<|endoftext|>.@RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation.No focus, poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying<|endoftext|>Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!<|endoftext|>The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her. Just watch.<|endoftext|>By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the 
Al-Shabaab terror video. <|endoftext|>The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts, was amazing. 10,000 people going wild. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country. New Years Eve was a disaster. THINK!<|endoftext|>HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump! Very proud of you!
 <|endoftext|>Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: <|endoftext|>The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate!<|endoftext|>.@Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott.<|endoftext|>It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!<|endoftext|>Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART!<|endoftext|>We could only get a small fraction of this 25k crowd in. The movement to Make America Great Again is unbelievable! <|endoftext|>Great time in Burlington, Vermont. Crowd was amazing.<|endoftext|>Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!<|endoftext|>I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!<|endoftext|>Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can’t compete!<|endoftext|>#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 <|endoftext|>#FoxNews Poll - THANK YOU!

I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it!<|endoftext|>Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled).<|endoftext|>(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week.

<|endoftext|>I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!<|endoftext|>I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!<|endoftext|>Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding!<|endoftext|>In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over!<|endoftext|>Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...<|endoftext|>I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. <|endoftext|>If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.<|endoftext|>This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.<|endoftext|>UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.<|endoftext|>Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!<|endoftext|>Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!<|endoftext|>So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical!<|endoftext|>.@RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.<|endoftext|>Thank you Michael Harrison @Talkersmagazine for your kind words - greatly appreciated!<|endoftext|>.@MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter!<|endoftext|>Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson<|endoftext|>.@stuartpstevens horrible advise to Mitt Romney made victory an impossibility. Don't blame Mitt! Now Stevens can't get a job!<|endoftext|>The Tonight Show begins in 5 minutes. Enjoy!<|endoftext|>Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. <|endoftext|>New CBS poll. #Trump2016
<|endoftext|>The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU<|endoftext|>The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!<|endoftext|>Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.<|endoftext|>The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!<|endoftext|>Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters!<|endoftext|>Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW!<|endoftext|>Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue!<|endoftext|>.@EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016<|endoftext|>Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?<|endoftext|>Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!<|endoftext|>Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on?<|endoftext|>United States looks more and more like a paper tiger. Won't be that way if I win!<|endoftext|>.@TheBrodyFile: "Trump's appeal to evangelicals is real" #Trump2016  <|endoftext|>Do you think Iran would have acted so tough if they were Russian sailors?

Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so<|endoftext|>Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable<|endoftext|>Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!<|endoftext|>The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!<|endoftext|>Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.<|endoftext|>Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?<|endoftext|>Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!<|endoftext|>Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. 
<|endoftext|>If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?<|endoftext|>Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!<|endoftext|>When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.<|endoftext|>Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St<|endoftext|>Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite<|endoftext|>Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? <|endoftext|>Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. <|endoftext|>In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list.

Bad!<|endoftext|>During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.<|endoftext|>Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.<|endoftext|>The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud<|endoftext|>And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!<|endoftext|>Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.<|endoftext|>This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud <|endoftext|>The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!<|endoftext|>Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!<|endoftext|>Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."<|endoftext|>THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight!

She is so average in so many ways!<|endoftext|>Great to be back in Arizona!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 <|endoftext|>Wow, @CNN ratings are up 75% because it's "all Trump, all the time." The networks are making a fortune off of me!

Keep up the great work! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain<|endoftext|>The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit.

SAD!<|endoftext|>The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters!<|endoftext|>So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong!<|endoftext|>Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there!<|endoftext|>Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others.

Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!<|endoftext|>Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!<|endoftext|>Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.

That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!<|endoftext|>I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first!<|endoftext|>While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race!<|endoftext|>I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win.

Both talk about ISIS, do nothing!<|endoftext|>These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!<|endoftext|>Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right!<|endoftext|>It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO!<|endoftext|>Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST!<|endoftext|>.@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on.

Massive front page for that!<|endoftext|>Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!<|endoftext|>The media is really on a witch-hunt against me.

Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).<|endoftext|>Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much" ...<|endoftext|>especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states<|endoftext|>Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting.

This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality. Such hatred! When will the U.S., and all countries, fight back?<|endoftext|>Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity."  So true!<|endoftext|>.@NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: "until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes."  Dishonest!<|endoftext|>The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace.Too bad, but we will get it done anyway!<|endoftext|>#MerryChristmas <|endoftext|>Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone!<|endoftext|>President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc.<|endoftext|>The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.

Nice!<|endoftext|>General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!<|endoftext|>People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"<|endoftext|>The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare.<|endoftext|>With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it<|endoftext|>........may be, their number one act and priority.

Thank you.<|endoftext|>The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!<|endoftext|>Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!<|endoftext|>Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning - much more to follow<|endoftext|>Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have "hacking defense" like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible......<|endoftext|>things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass.<|endoftext|>Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases......<|endoftext|>like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web...<|endoftext|>massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful!<|endoftext|>The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they..<|endoftext|>...do the typical political thing and BLAME. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning."Keep you doctor, keep your plan!"

Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We.....<|endoftext|>have enough problems around the world without yet another one.

A Great Wall would be however a far easier & less expensive solution. We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others making them like new. The Democrats.....<|endoftext|>....however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease. Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.......<|endoftext|>.....I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi. In 2006 Democrats voted for a Wall and they were right to do so. Today they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built...<|endoftext|>....People do not yet realize how much of the Wall including really effective renovation has already been built.

Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada) the USMCA is so much better than the old very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal that just by the money we save MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!<|endoftext|>I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called “advice of counsel” and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. That is why they get paid. Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly......<|endoftext|>....stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance. Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not...<|endoftext|>....guilty even on a civil bases.

Badly needed!<|endoftext|>So great to watch this! <|endoftext|>Anything in this very interesting world is possible but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea & will do nothing to interfere or end it. He also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!<|endoftext|>Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia. Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on “Russia Collusion.” The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!<|endoftext|>How can it be possible that James Woods (and many others) a strong but responsible Conservative Voice is banned from Twitter? Social Media & Fake News Media together with their partner the Democrat Party have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!<|endoftext|>Mike has been a fantastic Senator! <|endoftext|>The Kentuky Derby decision was not a good one. It was a rough and tumble race on a wet and sloppy track actually a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur.

These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars....<|endoftext|>....of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25%. The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by China. The Trade Deal with China continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate. No!<|endoftext|>After spending more than $35000000 over a two year period interviewing 500 people using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats & 49 FBI Agents - all culminating in a more than 400 page Report showing NO COLLUSION - why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller.......<|endoftext|>....to testify. Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report) and NO OBSTRUCTION. Bob Mueller should not testify. No redos for the Dems!<|endoftext|>“The Report sounded an awful lot as being Comeyesque in other words I’m not going to charge this person (there wasn’t even close to being a crime) but I’m going to criticize him on the way out the door. That’s unfortunate because it’s stepping outside of the role.” Robert Ray<|endoftext|>“This is not Congressional Oversight this is bullying.” Jason Riley The Wall Street Journal<|endoftext|>Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history they have stollen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back.....<|endoftext|>....The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>Pending the confirmation of Mark Morgan as our Nation’s new ICE Director Matt Albence will serve in the role of Acting Director.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<|endoftext|>“Democrat Texas Congressman Al Green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent President Trump from re-election in 2020.” @OANN  In other words Dems can’t win the election fairly. You can’t impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country’s history.....<|endoftext|>Also there are “No High Crimes & Misdemeanors” No Collusion No Conspiracy No Obstruction. ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE and that’s what the Dems should be looking at but they won’t. Nevertheless the tables are turning!<|endoftext|>The United States has been losing for many years 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade. With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry we’re not going to be doing that anymore!<|endoftext|>Scott Walker is 100% correct when he says that the Republicans must WAKE UP to the Democrats State by State power grab. They play very dirty actually like never before. Don’t allow them to get away with what they are doing!<|endoftext|>Puerto Rico has been given more money by Congress for Hurricane Disaster Relief 91 Billion Dollars than any State in the history of the U.S. As an example Florida got $12 Billion & Texas $39 Billion for their monster hurricanes. Now the Democrats are saying NO Relief to......<|endoftext|>....Alabama Iowa Nebraska Georgia South Carolina North Carolina and others unless much more money is given to Puerto Rico. The Dems don’t want farmers to get any help. Puerto Rico should be very happy and the Dems should stop blocking much needed Disaster Relief!<|endoftext|>Just spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan concerning North Korea and Trade. Very good conversation!<|endoftext|>Democrats in Congress must vote to close the terrible loopholes at the Southern Border. If not harsh measures will have to be taken!<|endoftext|>Congratulations @TigerWoods - you are truly one of a kind! <|endoftext|>He wants to impeach because they can’t win election. Sad! <|endoftext|>I am pleased to inform you that THE BIG FIREWORKS after many years of not having any are coming back to beautiful Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.

Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered “tax shelter” ......<|endoftext|>....you would get it by building or even buying. You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks it was sport. Additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!<|endoftext|>The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to “negotiate” with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come....<|endoftext|>....Guess what that’s not going to happen! China has just informed us that they (Vice-Premier) are now coming to the U.S. to make a deal. We’ll see but I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S. not good for China!<|endoftext|>“The real “Obstruction of Justice” is what the Democrats are trying to do to this Attorney General.” Congressman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). @MariaBartiromo<|endoftext|>“Shouldn’t 2015 and 2016 be revealed how Intelligence Agencies FBI tried to sabotage a particular campaign - never been done before?” @SteveForbesCEO @MariaBartiromo<|endoftext|>Big Court win at our Southern Border!
